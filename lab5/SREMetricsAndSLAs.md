## SRE key metrics:

1. Uptime. This metric represents the percentage of time that service is running successfully.
2. Response time. This indicator determines the time required for the service to respond to the client.
3. Error rate. It measures the percentage of processing errors that occur while the service is running.
4. Throughput. This metric measures the load the system is receiving at a given time from user operations.

## GitHub service SLA

## Google Kubernetes Engine SLA

Kubernetes provide uptime percentage varying from 99.5% to 99.9% for different levels
of service. Metric is computed monthly.

## Importance of SRE metrics

These metrics are useful when it comes to defining what is considered acceptable service performance.
